Drug discovery is a step-by-step process in which new drugs are discovered. In general, 
pharmaceutical companies follow well Pharmacology and chemistry-based drug discovery 
approaches, and face various difficulties in finding new drugs. Purpose of drug availability 
to produce more drugs a short term with low risk in bioinformatics. In fact, there is now a 
new, different, well-known field such as computer-aid drug design (CADD), Bioinformatics 
is experiencing a exponential growth of biological data have favored development of 
primary and secondary databases of nucleic acid sequences, protein sequences, and 
structures. Some of the most popular databases include ChEMBL, GenBank, SWISS-PROT, 
PDB, PIR, SCOP, CATH, etc., these information sites are available as a public domain 
information and hosted on various online servers throughout the earth. We undertook a 
deep study on Alzheimerâ€™s disease which attacks the single protein. When any new disease 
attacks the human body, it either inhibits the protein or releases it, which create an 
imbalance in the body. This imbalance in the body is the reason behind illness and other 
effects in the body. We created a dataset in which different compounds are compared. 
First, they are checked on Lipinski Descriptor for the drug likeliness of the compound. Then 
Padel Descriptors are used to generate molecular fingerprints which are fed to the model. 
Then the results are predicted.
